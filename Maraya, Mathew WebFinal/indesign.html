            inDesign was interesting. There were many applications and techniques that I could see myself using in a more professional setting. It was fun to see all of my previous work laid out in front of me and to see the progression of my skillset building. Aside from video game art, I am drawn to more graphic and structural designs. I wanted to incorporate that with my retro style and I came up with a Great Gatsby-esque design. I'm fairly happy with the way it turned out.
