            Animate was extremely difficult. There were so many new concepts and techniques that were hard to integrate with my current skillset. One thing I did want to accomplish was using a more organic looking motion-tween instead of just having a character moving without actually “moving”. So I used a super simple character design where I could get away using a 3-frame walking animation to loop indefinitely. I accomplished that; but it took so much more time than I realized. All the graphics are the early stages of a video game I am working on so it was kinda cool to show that to everyone.
