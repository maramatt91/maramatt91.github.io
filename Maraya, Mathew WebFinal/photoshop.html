            I have used photoshop before so this project was enjoyable to create. My subject matter and art style is heavily influenced by video games. So I took a photo of my dog at the beach and I wanted to essentially create a background using that photo as inspiration.  Melding that with my particular affinity for game art led to creating a city by the water when the sun was setting. I could have-- and wanted to-- add more elements in the foreground as well as incorporate type better, but I only realized that by the time everything was already submitted.
