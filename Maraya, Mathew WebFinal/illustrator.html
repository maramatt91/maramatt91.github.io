            Transitioning from only using photoshop to using Adobe Illustrator proved to be quite challenging. However, I wanted to challenge myself using one of my more complex character designs that I created before taking this class and re-create him as a vector. I paired him with just a simple background that I whipped up because I had to edit how complex I wanted the composition to be. Overall, I am extremely happy with the way it turned out if I could redo this I would probably make a more fitting setting for my dude.
